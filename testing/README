Relevant files for the running the tests. For running the buildbot Master, and Slave for Continuous integration will go here for now.

Code needed to run tests place in the testing/src directory.
Makefile will be there to compile and send output to testing/bin
The Makefiles, scripts, and binaries needed to rin tests will be all placed in testing/bin.

All the related buildbot files will go into testing/buildbot

Need to place spec for running tests.
make compile testname board port
make upload testname board port
make getTestResult  testname board port

This needs to be repeated for each board attached to the test box.
